Such a thrilling game and the partisan RCB crowd get what they wanted - their side into the playoffs at the expense of CSK. 6 on the trot for RCB and they are a side bubbling with momentum. They will go to Ahmedabad to play the Eliminator and will wait to face their opponents. That will be known tomorrow. On that note we sign off. It's been a pleasure to bring you the coverage of this. Hope you enjoyed it. The cricket continues and there's no respite. We will be back tomorrow. On behalf of Nikhil Jadhav, Pradeep Krishnamurthy and Harish Vutakuru our scorer, this is me (Srivathsa) signing off. Remember to sleep tight and smile. Bye."},
            {"over":"","text":"Faf du Plessis | RCB captain and Player of the Match: What a night. Unbelievable and such a great atmosphere, such a pleasure to finish off the season at home with a win. Batting first, I think it was the hardest pitch I have ever played on in T20s. Myself and Virat were talking about 140-150 after we came back from the rain break. The communication from the umpires was there was a lot of rain on the pitch, they wanted to push the game and that makes sense. When we came back, my goodness, I was telling Mitch Santner it was like a day 5 Test match at Ranchi and to get 200 on that was unbelievable. The last 6 games the batters have batted with good intent and good strike-rate. We were slow earlier on and we wanted more intent and that was awesome. We were defending 175, it got a bit close, at one stage, with MS there, I thought, oh dear, he has done it so many times. The way we bowled with the wet ball was unbelievable, we tried to change it. I dedicate this Man of the Match to Yash Dayal. The way he bowled was unbelievable. For a man who's fairly new, he deserves it. [on what he told Dayal before the last over] Pace off is the best option on this pitch and trust your skills and enjoy, this is what you trained for. The yorker did not work the 1st ball and he went back to pace off and it worked unbelievably well. [on the crowd tonight] It's crazy, even when we weren't winning the fans were here. We in the changeroom we felt it was something we had to get right. Coming here tonight, it was set up nicely, CSK v RCB, unbelievable atmosphere and we as a team will do a lap of honour to thank the crowd for the support. It's really important that we enjoy this, great 6 games in a row and the first goal in the IPL is to get into the knockouts and we have done that, enjoy this but get back to work tomorrow."},
